# DAI – DLang Artificial Intelligence Playground

This repository serves as a centralized collection of my experimental AI projects, all written in the **D Programming Language**.
It is a **playground** for exploring various ideas in artificial intelligence, language understanding, and logic systems, built from scratch using only native D code — without relying on external machine learning frameworks.

Each subdirectory in this repo represents a different AI experiment or concept, ranging from dictionary-based chatbots to semantic parsers and symbolic analyzers.

## Structure

```
dai/
├── dictionary_based_chatbot/       # A semantic chatbot using dictionary-driven logic
├── improve_dictionary_based_chatbot/ # Refined version with better token weighting & context handling
├── svo_checker/                    # Subject-Verb-Object structure analyzer
├── etc..  
└── README.md
```

## Philosophy

* **CPU-friendly**: Designed to run on regular machines, no GPU required
* **Interpretable**: All logic is explicit and human-readable
* **Minimalistic**: No dependencies, no magic — just plain DLang
* **Iterative**: Each folder reflects a stage in learning and discovery

> This is not just a repository. It’s a journal of AI exploration through the lens of handcrafted code.
